Creating documentation formatters

  This is how to create documentation formatters.
  
  We should talk about how to document a documentation formatter. This is accomplished by using the com.github.aamm.hyphenType.documentation.Description annotation. See the source code of the StandardFormatter for more information.
  
  The Description tag accepts documentation with multiple lines (having the \n character separating the lines). This is useful to format the documentation of a formatter.
