Options interface

  An option interface is a standard Java interface that both (1) tells hyphenType how to parse the command lines, and (2) provides an easy way to access the parsed data structure and some helper methods.
  
  All option interfaces must extend the {{{./apidocs/com/github/aamm/hyphenType/datastructure/Options.html}com.github.aamm.hyphenType.datastructure.Options}} interface. This is essential, because the helper methods are declared in the Options interface.
